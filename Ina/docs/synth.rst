The generator is based on VSynth main waveform generator (see analog LZX generators) and it's normal controls.
It is possible to choose the type of wave from Sine, Triangular, Ramp, Square and full Noise. Some controls are provided such as frequency and time.
Also some of the mixer effects might be included for pre-processing.
