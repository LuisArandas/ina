Drawing
===============

Interface
-------------------------------

The Drawing interface allows the artist to paint while mapping. It is possible to select different strokes,
the colors of the pencil and of the background. New brushes should be added in next versions. The connectivity
with Human Interfaces such as drawing tables should be possible (get mouse control over the mouse).
The Clean and the Default buttons allow the interface to clean itself and to get back to the main state (blue)
