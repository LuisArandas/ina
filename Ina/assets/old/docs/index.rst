[Ina] Software Documentation
===============================

This is the official documentation of the Ina video synthesis 
and mapping sofware. It is a free standalone software and tool
that was developed to merge some features and tools that were 
found in other video softwares for a personal and/or commercial
use. Combining synthesis, drawing, and video mapping in one tool.
All of the features will be explained here and further development
will be documented as well. Test

.. tip::
    This software was developed using MaxMSP visual programming tool so there are ``.maxpat`` files in the source that might need a version
    of the software to edit in the way it was done (also able to open as ``.json``).
    (The next version of Ina is currently being developed in other framework, more news comming soon).
